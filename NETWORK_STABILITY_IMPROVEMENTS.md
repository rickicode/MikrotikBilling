# Mikrotik Billing System - Network Stability Improvements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines comprehensive network stability improvements implemented to address Mikrotik RouterOS API connection issues, reduce system instability, and enhance overall performance. The improvements focus on connection pooling, fault tolerance, monitoring, and optimized resource management.
