# PostgreSQL Migration Summary for Mikrotik Billing System

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive migration and testing process to ensure the Mikrotik Billing System uses PostgreSQL consistently throughout the entire application.

## What Was Checked

### ✅ Database Configuration
- **DatabaseManager**: Uses PostgreSQL with pg library
- **Connection Pool**: Properly configured with connection pooling
- **Environment Variables**: Configured for PostgreSQL (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD)

### ✅ Route Files (Fixed)
Fixed database access patterns in:
- `src/routes/customers.js` - Customer management
- `src/routes/profiles.js` - Profile management
- `src/routes/vouchers.js` - Voucher management
- `src/routes/pppoe.js` - PPPoE user management
- `src/routes/whatsapp.js` - WhatsApp integration
- `src/routes/vendors.js` - Vendor management
- `src/routes/print.js` - Print functionality
- `src/routes/api.js` - API endpoints
- `src/routes/security.js` - Security features

**Changes Made:**
- Added DatabaseManager imports where needed
- Replaced `fastify.db.get()` with `db.getOne()`
- Replaced `fastify.db.run()` with `db.insert()`/`db.update()`/`db.delete()`
- Replaced `fastify.db.prepare().all()` with `db.getMany()`
- Fixed all SQLite patterns to use PostgreSQL/Knex patterns

### ✅ Service Files (Already Correct)
- `Scheduler.js` - Uses `fastify.db.getPool()` correctly
- `MikrotikClient.js` - Uses DatabaseManager through `db.query()`
- `PaymentService.js` - Uses PostgreSQL correctly
- `WhatsAppService.js` - Uses proper database patterns
- All other services - Verified to use PostgreSQL

### ✅ Model Files (Already Correct)
- `BaseModel.js` - Uses DatabaseManager with PostgreSQL
- All model classes extend BaseModel with PostgreSQL support
- Proper CRUD operations defined

### ✅ Migration Files (Already Correct)
- All SQL files use PostgreSQL syntax
- Proper SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
- JSONB fields for structured data
- BOOLEAN type for boolean fields
- DECIMAL for financial values
- TIMESTAMP with timezone support

## Testing Setup

### ✅ Playwright E2E Tests Created
- `tests/postgresql-integration.spec.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- `playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration
- `tests/global-setup.js` - Test environment setup
- `tests/global-teardown.js` - Test environment cleanup

**Test Coverage:**
- Authentication (login/logout)
- Customer management (CRUD operations)
- Voucher management (generation, search)
- PPPoE user management
- Profile management
- Payment system integration
- Dashboard statistics
- Database consistency
- Performance tests
- Concurrent operations

### ✅ Database Test Script
- `scripts/test-postgresql.js` - Comprehensive database testing
- Tests CRUD operations
- Tests PostgreSQL-specific features (JSONB, arrays, window functions, CTEs)
- Performance benchmarking
- Transaction testing

## Package.json Updates

### ✅ New Test Scripts Added
```json
{
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
  "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
  "test:e2e:codegen": "playwright codegen http://localhost:3000",
  "test:db": "node scripts/test-postgresql.js",
  "test:all": "npm run test && npm run test:e2e",
  "postinstall": "playwright install"
}
```

## How to Run Tests

### 1. Database Test Only
```bash
npm run test:db
```

### 2. E2E Tests (with UI)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### 3. All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```

### 4. Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test tests/postgresql-integration.spec.js
```

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=mikrotik_billing
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Migration Scripts Created

### 1. `scripts/fix-database-patterns.js`
Automated script to fix SQLite patterns to PostgreSQL patterns in all route files.

### 2. `scripts/test-postgresql.js`
Comprehensive database testing script that verifies:
- Connection status
- CRUD operations
- PostgreSQL-specific features
- Performance benchmarks

## Known Issues Fixed

1. **SQLite Patterns**: Replaced all `fastify.db.get()`, `fastify.db.run()`, `fastify.db.prepare().all()` with proper DatabaseManager methods
2. **Missing Imports**: Added DatabaseManager imports in all route files
3. **Inconsistent Query Patterns**: Standardized all database queries to use Knex/PostgreSQL patterns

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling configured (min: 5, max: 20 connections)
- Query timeout set to 30 seconds
- Proper indexing recommended for large datasets
- JSONB fields for structured data storage

## Security Notes

- Password hashing uses bcrypt
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Role-based access control maintained
- Proper transaction handling

## Next Steps

1. Run the database test to verify PostgreSQL connection:
   ```bash
   npm run test:db
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run E2E tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. Review test results and fix any remaining issues

## Conclusion

The Mikrotik Billing System has been successfully analyzed and updated to ensure PostgreSQL consistency throughout the entire application. All SQLite patterns have been replaced with PostgreSQL/Knex patterns, and comprehensive testing has been set up to verify the implementation.

The application is now ready to run exclusively on PostgreSQL with proper testing coverage to ensure all functionality works correctly.
